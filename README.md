## 💡 What is Turbo Console Log?

**Turbo Console Log is the standard tool for automated logging in JavaScript and TypeScript.**

It helps you insert, manage, and clean log statements across your code — whether you're using `console.log`, `debug`, `warn`, `table`, or even a fully custom logging function.

Powered by a full **AST engine**, Turbo understands your code structure and adds logs precisely where they belong — making debugging faster, smarter, and less repetitive.

Used by nearly **2 million developers**, Turbo removes friction from your dev flow and keeps your codebase clean.
